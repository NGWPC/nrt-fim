## eval_mode defines where to forward-run the model. It can be:
## 1- "train": uses the all observations used in training mode. they list is in Dataset/splits/train.json
## 2- "eval": uses the all observations that were not used in training mode. they list is in Dataset/splits/eval.json
## 3- "user_defined": uses the bbox and time that is defined by the user in the following parts
eval_mode: user_defined

## if eval_mode == user_defined --> the bbox and time will be read from "inference"
inference:
  bbox: {"left": -89.0, "bottom": 35.23, "right": -86.0, "top": 39.23}
  crs: EPSG:4326       # this is the crs of the bbox defined in the upper row
  end_time: 2001-12-07T00:00:00    # YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SS     the last hour that data is available to predict the flood

# Put eval outputs **under the training run** (clean, discoverable)
